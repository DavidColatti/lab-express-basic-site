            Zip2
Main article: Zip2
In 1995, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, started Zip2, a web software company, with money raised from a small group of angel investors.[39] The company developed and marketed an internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions and yellow pages[61], with the vector graphics mapping and direction code being implemented by Musk in Java.[62] Musk obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune,[63][64] and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.[65] Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted by the board.[43] Compaq acquired Zip2 for US$307 million in cash[43]:109 in February 1999.[66] Musk received US$22 million for his 7 percent share from the sale.[63][43]:109[64]

X.com and PayPal
Main articles: PayPal and X.com
In March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, with US$10 million from the sale of Zip2.[65][64] One year later, the company merged with Confinity,[63][67] which had a money-transfer service called PayPal.[64] The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[68] Musk was ousted in October 2000 from his role as CEO (although he remained on the board) due to disagreements with other company executives over his desire to move PayPal's Unix-based infrastructure to Microsoft Windows.[69] In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for US$1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk received US$165 million.[70] Before its sale, Musk, who was the company's largest shareholder, owned 11.7% of PayPal's shares.[71]

In July 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, stating that it has sentimental value to him.[72]

SpaceX
Main article: SpaceX
In 2001, Musk conceived Mars Oasis, a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on Mars, containing food crops growing on Martian regolith, in an attempt to reawaken public interest in space exploration.[73][74] In October 2001, Musk traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished Dnepr Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the envisioned payloads into space. The group met with companies such as NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers.[75] The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin. Griffin had worked for the CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel, as well as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and was just leaving Orbital Sciences, a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for US$8 million. Musk considered the price too high, and stormed out of the meeting. On the flight back from Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed.[75] According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson,[76] Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. It was concluded that, in theory, by applying vertical integration and the modular approach employed in software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70-percent gross margin.[77] Ultimately, Musk ended up founding SpaceX with the long-term goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization.[78][dead link]
